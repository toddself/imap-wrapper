# imap-wrapper

A not-quite-yet finished wrapper around [mscdex/node-imap](https://github.com/mscdex/node-imap) providing a higher-level API for interacting with an IMAP server.  Currently based on a [for of node-imap](https://github.com/toddself/node-imap) to provide CRAM-MD5 authentication as well.
